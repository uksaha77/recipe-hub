# Italian Sub Sandwich

Looking for a sandwich to make for a quick weeknight dinner, take to your next backyard BBQ or simply divide, wrap, and eat for lunch throughout the week? Well, this Italian Super Sub Sandwich is the answer. It’s loaded with salami, turkey breast, pepperoni, and, of course, banana peppers

## What Is an Italian Sandwich?

Generally, an Italian sandwich has a combination of cured meats – I like to add roast turkey to mine also, but that’s not completely traditional.
For cheeses, provolone is standard and what I like best, but Swiss is nice too!

Besides loads of meats and cheese on an Italian sandwich, it usually has a chopped mix of pickled.

## Why Italian Subs Make Great Party Sandwiches

This is such a great party sandwich option because you just make one huge sandwich and chop it up into the portions you need.

If you aren’t planning any parties anytime soon, this makes great fast lunches or a quick and easy dinner for a house of hungry people!

## The Best Bread for Italian Sandwiches

I like a soft Italian loaf for my sandwich. The key to making this loaf work is to cut it in half and remove some of the inner breading from the top half of the loaf. This will give you more room for the fillings!

## Suggestions and Substitutions

One of the most fun things to do for a sandwich like this is to go to your favorite deli and just pick a few cured meats to add to your sandwich.

When it comes to vegetables, you can definitely get creative.
## Tips and Tricks for Packing This Sandwich

If you are packing this up for a party on the go, I’d recommend wrapping the sandwich whole and chopping it when you get to where you are going.

#### Ingredients

1. 1 large loaf Italian bread
2. 1/3 cup mayonnaise
3. 4 ounces Genoa salami
4. 4 ounces pepperoni
5. 8 ounces roasted turkey breast
6. 6 ounces Provolone cheese
7. 2 cups chopped iceberg lettuce


## Method
## Prepare the bread:
Cut Italian loaf in half longwise with a serrated knife. Scoop out some of the bread in the top half of the loaf. This will give you more room for toppings and make sure the sandwich doesn’t fall apart. Just don’t go too deep. You still need it to hold together. (Use the leftover bread to make breadcrumbs!)

## Layer the meats and cheese:
Spread mayonnaise on the bottom half of the loaf. Layer the meats and cheese on the bottom portion of the loaf in any order you like. I prefer to the do the cured meats on the bottom, then turkey, and then cheese, but there is no science to it.

## Finish the sandwich:
Chop the iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, banana peppers, and olives. Add a bed of lettuce to the top half of the loaf (that has been hollowed slightly).

Top with chopped tomatoes, peppers, and olives. Drizzle the vegetables liberally with extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, and Italian seasoning.
