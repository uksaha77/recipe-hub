A cappuccino is an espresso drink with steamed milk, milk foam and espresso. It’s very similar to a latte (cafe latte), but the proportion of steamed milk is different. Here’s the breakdown of a latte vs cappuccino:

A cappuccino has equal parts espresso, steamed milk and foam (⅓ each).
A latte is ⅓ espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, with a thin layer of foam on top. Here’s a chart that breaks it down!
The differences between the two drinks are pretty subtle, and so is the flavor. But you’re in luck: the cappuccino is the easier of the two to perfect at home. With a latte you’re looking for microfoam, steamed milk with a wet-paint like texture that’s almost impossible to get without an espresso machine. A cappuccino can easily be made with frothed milk using various tools: even a whisk!
You’ll need to make espresso for a cappuccino: simply strong coffee will not do! This means you’ll need the following:

Espresso roast coffee: The roast is important to get the right dark, bitter flavor. Also make sure to use a fine grind on the espresso when you make it.
Espresso machine, manual espresso maker, or Aeropress: There are several ways to make espresso. We use an espresso machine, which sits on a countertop. Or you can use a small manual espresso maker: it’s cheaper and portable! The cheapest option is an Aeropress: it doesn’t make nearly as good of espresso, but it does the job. Go to Aeropress Espresso.
