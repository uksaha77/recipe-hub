Maple Cupcakes


Ingredients

1 cup maple syrup

5 tablespoons margarine

1 large egg

1 ½ cups all-purpose flour

½ cup whole wheat flour

2 ¼ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon ground nutmeg

½ teaspoon salt

¼ teaspoon ground ginger

½ cup milk


Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin tins.

Beat maple syrup and margarine together in a large bowl until well mixed and creamy. Mix in egg until combined.

Combine all-purpose and whole wheat flours, baking powder, nutmeg, salt, and ginger in a small bowl. Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in batches, alternating with the milk, beating batter briefly after each addition. Fill the prepared muffin cups 3/4 full with batter.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes.
