Ingredients:
For the rice:
2 cups basmati rice
4 cups water
1 cinnamon stick
4 cardamom pods
4 cloves
1 bay leaf
Salt, to taste

For the chicken:
1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
1 cup plain yogurt
1 tbsp. ginger paste
1 tbsp. garlic paste
1 tsp. cumin powder
1 tsp. coriander powder
1 tsp. turmeric powder
1 tsp. chili powder
1 tsp. garam masala
Salt, to taste

For the biryani:
1 large onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1/2 cup fried onions (store-bought or homemade)

Instructions:
Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in cold water for at least 30 minutes.
In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked rice, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, bay leaf, and salt to taste. Stir well and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and tender. Drain any excess water and set the rice aside.
In a large bowl, mix together the chicken, yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, chili powder, garam masala, and salt to taste. Set aside and let marinate for at least 30 minutes.
In a large frying pan or wok, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and fry until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove the onions from the oil and set them aside on a paper towel.
In the same oil, add the marinated chicken and stir-fry until the chicken is cooked through.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a large baking dish, layer half of the cooked rice on the bottom. Add the cooked chicken on top of the rice. Sprinkle half of the chopped cilantro, mint leaves, raisins, and sliced almonds over the chicken. Add the remaining rice on top of the chicken and sprinkle the remaining chopped cilantro, mint leaves, raisins, and sliced almonds on top.
Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until heated through.
To serve, sprinkle the fried onions on top of the biryani. Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken biryani!

Note: You can also substitute the chicken with your preferred protein or make a vegetarian version by using vegetables like cauliflower, potatoes, or peas.
