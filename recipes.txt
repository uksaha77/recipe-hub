Directions
Whisk mayonnaise, vinegar, Dijon, salt, black pepper, and cayenne together in a bowl until well blended. Whisk in sugar, then stir in celery, bell pepper, carrot, green onions, jalapeño pepper, and poblano pepper. Cover and refrigerate until macaroni is ready.

Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain but do not rinse.

Let macaroni drain in a colander for about 5 minutes, shaking out the moisture from time to time. Pour macaroni into a large bowl; toss to separate and let cool to room temperature, 10 to 15 minutes. Macaroni should be sticky.

Pour dressing over macaroni and stir until evenly distributed. Cover and refrigerate until macaroni absorbs the dressing, at least 4 hours or overnight if possible.

Stir salad before serving. Mix water and remaining mayonnaise into salad for a fresher look.

** Spanish-Style Hot Chocolate
Spanish-Style Hot Chocolate – Thinner to Winner

 

The first time I made Spanish-Style hot chocolate, I made the mistake of using an authentic recipe, and didn’t love the experience. If I’d been craving some type of warm, drinkable chocolate pudding, it would have been amazing, but when I want to savor and sip a cup of “hot chocolate,” I don’t want to have to work that hard to swallow.

 

So, I cut down on the cornstarch, and used a little less chocolate, and eventually came up with what I think is a perfect formula. This is just thick enough to be decadent, and intensely chocolaty without being overwhelming. Your results may vary. You might enjoy yours thicker, or thinner, so experimentation is always welcomed. If you do want to use this as a dip for churros or toasted bread, then simply double the starch, and up the chocolate to taste.

 

I love dark, bittersweet chocolate for this, but I know that’s not everyone’s thing, so obviously use what you like. But, just be sure to reduce the sugar accordingly, otherwise it’s easy to make this too sweet. Lastly, be sure to serve this piping hot the second the chocolate melts in, and in warm cups, if at all possible. If you’re a chocolate lover, this is a very special treat, and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!

Ingredients
4 ounces dark chocolate (70% cacao), broken or cut into 1/2-inch pieces

2 1/4 cups whole milk

2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste

1 pinch of salt

1/2 teaspoon cornstarch

cayenne pepper to garnish top

Directions
Break up chocolate into small pieces and set aside.

Add milk, sugar, salt, and cornstarch to a saucepan, and whisk thoroughly.

Place over medium to medium-high heat, and cook stirring until the milk just starts to simmer.

Remove milk from heat, and quickly whisk in chocolate until completely melted and emulsified.

Serve immediately in hot cups, garnished with a pinch of cayenne on top if desired.
