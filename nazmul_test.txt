Ingredients for a strawberry smoothie:

1 cup frozen strawberries
1 banana
1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
1/2 cup milk (or almond milk)
1 tsp honey (optional)
Ice cubes (optional)
Instructions:

Add the frozen strawberries, banana, Greek yogurt, and milk to a blender.
If desired, add a teaspoon of honey to sweeten the smoothie.
Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. If the mixture is too thick, add a few ice cubes to thin it out.
Pour the smoothie into a glass and serve immediately.
This recipe makes one serving, but you can easily double or triple the recipe to make more servings. You can also add other ingredients to the smoothie, such as spinach, chia seeds, or protein powder, to boost its nutritional value. Enjoy!
